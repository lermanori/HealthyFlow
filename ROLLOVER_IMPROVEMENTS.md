# Rollover Feature Improvements

## Problem
The rollover feature was creating new database entries for every rolled-over task, leading to:
- Database clutter with duplicate tasks
- Performance issues with many rolled-over tasks
- Inconsistent behavior compared to habits

## Solution
Modified the rollover feature to work **virtually** (like habits do):

### Changes Made

1. **Virtual Rollover Display**: Tasks without dates are now displayed virtually for the target date without creating database entries
2. **Database Cleanup**: Created cleanup script to remove existing rolled-over tasks
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Rollover tasks now behave like virtual habit instances

### Files Modified

- `backend/src/supabase-client.ts`: Enhanced `getTasksWithRecurringHabits` to include virtual rollover tasks
- `backend/src/routes/tasks.ts`: Modified rollover endpoint to not create database entries
- `backend/src/routes/tasks.ts`: Updated task completion to handle virtual rollover tasks
- `src/services/api.ts`: Added `isRolloverTask` field to Task interface

### New Files

- `backend/cleanup-rollover-tasks.js`: Script to clean up existing rolled-over tasks
- `backend/run-cleanup.sh`: Convenience script to run cleanup
- `ROLLOVER_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: This documentation

### How It Works Now

1. **Rollover Process**: When you rollover tasks, they're displayed virtually for the target date
2. **Task Completion**: When you complete a virtual rollover task, it creates a real database entry
3. **No Database Clutter**: No more duplicate tasks cluttering the database
4. **Consistent UX**: Rollover tasks behave exactly like virtual habit instances

### Running the Cleanup

```bash
cd backend
chmod +x run-cleanup.sh
./run-cleanup.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd backend
node cleanup-rollover-tasks.js
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Cleaner database
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Consistent behavior with habits
- ✅ No more duplicate tasks
- ✅ Virtual display until completion

### Migration Notes

- Existing rolled-over tasks will be removed during cleanup
- New rollover behavior is backward compatible
- No changes needed in the frontend UI
