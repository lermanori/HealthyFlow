### 2026-06-19 20:00 — `main`

Verified issue #2 (AI parser canonical fields) end-to-end: `OPENAI_API_KEY` was added to `.env` and all three test phrases ("30 minute run tomorrow morning", "Weekly meal prep every Sunday 2 hours", "Take vitamins daily") returned correct `duration`, `repeat`, and `category` fields from GPT with no hardcoding. Diagnosed and fixed the UI not working: `VITE_API_URL` was pinned to the production Railway URL, so the browser was calling Railway (which has no API key) instead of localhost. Swapped it to `http://localhost:3001/api` for local dev. Production Railway still needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` added via the Railway dashboard before the AI analyzer works in prod.

### 2026-06-19 13:30 — `main`

Fixed the self-signup rate limiter crashing the backend on boot (`ERR_ERL_KEY_GEN_IPV6`): removed the unsafe custom `keyGenerator` in `auth.ts` and now rely on express-rate-limit's IPv6-safe default, with `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` in `index.ts` so `req.ip` resolves to the real client behind Railway's proxy (one bucket per client, not per proxy). Added `backend/scripts/seed-demo.ts`, an idempotent seed that upserts `demo@healthyflow.com` with a fresh `demo123` hash so the advertised demo credentials actually log in. All 17 backend tests still pass.

### 2026-06-19 12:00 — `issue-8-timeline-ordering`

Fixed a critical bug (#8) where tasks with a `start_time` earlier in the day sorted after afternoon tasks when the afternoon task had an earlier `created_at`. The root cause was a broken comparator in `getTasksWithRecurringHabits`: when only one of the two tasks had a `start_time`, the sort fell through to `created_at` order, completely ignoring the timed task's time value. Extracted a pure `sortTasksForTimeline` helper (with 4 unit tests that reproduce the bug) and wired it into `supabase-client.ts`, replacing the broken inline sort. All 17 backend tests pass; frontend typechecks clean.

### 2026-06-19 11:59 — `issue-13-prod-api-wiring`

Fixed production API wiring: changed `.env` to pin Railway URL (https://healthyflow-production.up.railway.app/api) instead of localhost:3001, so the Netlify build reads the correct backend. Dev fallback is preserved in src/services/api.ts for local development. Vite build passes.

### 2026-06-19 00:00 — `issue-14-self-signup`

Implemented P0.2 self-signup (issue #14): added a public POST /api/auth/signup route with Zod validation, bcrypt hashing, and JWT response — reusing every existing auth helper. Rate limiting (5 req/IP/15 min via express-rate-limit) is scoped to that route only; admin /register is untouched and regression-tested. All 7 new TDD tests (new email, duplicate email, short password, bad email, rate limit, admin regression x2) pass alongside the 6 existing backend tests (13 total). Frontend LoginPage.tsx now toggles between "Sign in" and "Create account" with inline error surfacing for duplicate email.

### 2026-06-19 17:24 — `issue-17-hide-item-types`

Hidden unbuilt item types (grocery, meal, workout) from the UI selector on AddItemPage. Filtered the itemTypes array to show only task and habit options, removing the user-facing selector buttons for the three types whose backends don't exist yet. Zod type definitions and TypeScript interfaces left untouched — the full types remain in the schema for v2.2 implementation. Frontend build and typecheck passed with no errors.

### 2026-06-19 09:19 — `issue-10-habit-bar`

Fixed the habit tracker progress bar not rendering on the dashboard. Root cause: the sidebar motion.div animation was not completing, leaving the sidebar element invisible (animating off-screen or stuck in initial state). Converted the sidebar from motion.div to a regular div, removing the Framer Motion animation that was preventing the card from rendering. Also corrected the backend's virtual habit instance detection to properly set isHabitInstance based on ID pattern matching instead of relying on a non-existent database field. Frontend build passed with no errors.

### 2026-06-19 16:32 — `issue-16-ask-ai-input`

Fixed the AskAI input collapsing after sending by converting single-answer state to a conversation thread array. Input now clears after each send but remains visible and focused, letting users ask follow-up questions immediately. Each exchange renders as question+answer pair in the thread, and quick-question buttons hide once conversation starts. Frontend build passed with no type errors.

### 2026-06-19 15:47 — `issue-15-sticky-footer`

Fixed the Analyze button hiding on scroll in the AITextAnalyzer modal. Restructured the modal into three flex zones: fixed header, scrollable content area, and fixed footer. Moved the "Analyze & Generate Tasks" button to the sticky footer so it remains visible and clickable regardless of content height. Both the analyze and add-tasks buttons now live in the footer, ensuring users can always trigger analysis. Build confirmed clean.

### 2026-06-18 12:15 — `main`

Simplified the commit workflow: the post-commit hook has been stripped down to a no-op, and the agent now owns the ledger directly — writing a narrative entry to LEDGER.md before each commit so it lands in the same commit as the code. CLAUDE.md documents the new workflow clearly. The GitHub Wiki Home page is live and a sync Action is in place to keep the Ledger wiki page up to date on every push.
