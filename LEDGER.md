### 2026-06-19 11:59 — `issue-13-prod-api-wiring`

Fixed production API wiring: changed `.env` to pin Railway URL (https://healthyflow-production.up.railway.app/api) instead of localhost:3001, so the Netlify build reads the correct backend. Dev fallback is preserved in src/services/api.ts for local development. Vite build passes.

### 2026-06-18 12:15 — `main`

Simplified the commit workflow: the post-commit hook has been stripped down to a no-op, and the agent now owns the ledger directly — writing a narrative entry to LEDGER.md before each commit so it lands in the same commit as the code. CLAUDE.md documents the new workflow clearly. The GitHub Wiki Home page is live and a sync Action is in place to keep the Ledger wiki page up to date on every push.
