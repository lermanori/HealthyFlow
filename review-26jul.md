HealthyFlow QA & UX Review (July 26 2025)
Overview
HealthyFlow positions itself as an AI‑powered productivity planner blending task management, habit tracking, grocery/meal/workout planning and voice interactions. The application uses a glass‑morphism inspired interface with responsive design and animated elements. During testing with the provided credentials on the live Netlify deployment, most of the core functionality worked, but several bugs and usability issues were observed.

Functional Analysis
Working features
Feature	Findings
Authentication	Logging in with the provided credentials worked, and sessions persisted between pages. The “Logout” link in the header is clearly visible.
Task creation & editing	Tasks can be created with title, category, date, time and duration. The Add Item page supports tasks, habits, grocery items, meals and workouts; each item type switches the form fields accordingly. Editing existing tasks through the task card’s context menu opens a modal with editable fields for title, category, start time, duration and quick‑date buttons (Today/Tomorrow/This Weekend/Next Week).
AI features (Basic mode)	The AI Task Analyzer modal accepts natural‑language input and generates structured tasks (though in Basic mode it returns preset tasks rather than interpreting the actual input). The Ask AI modal answers quick questions and analyses tasks, providing stats and suggestions about what to focus on

. Voice assistant toggles and a “Speak” button appear in the Analyzer to allow speech input; a “Voice Assistant” toggle controls auto‑speak

.
Notifications settings	The settings page includes toggles for push notifications, daily reminders, smart reminders and weekly reports

. Individual toggles worked in the UI (state changes visually).
Custom AI key support	A section in Settings allows the user to add an OpenAI API key; the form includes input fields and a save button. It promises local storage without sending the key to servers

.
Privacy controls	Users can export data, clear locally stored cache and even delete all tasks or delete their account from the settings page

.
Analytics	The Week View page shows a week overview with completion rate, tasks completed and total tasks. It also displays a weekly progress bar per day and a category progress bar (e.g., fitness tasks 3/3 completed) for the current week.
Modern UI	The app uses consistent color schemes, animated cards, gradient backgrounds and responsive design. Elements align well on desktop; the dark theme with translucent panels matches the glass‑morphism aesthetic.
Form diversity (Phase 1)	The Add Item form includes preliminary support for groceries, meals and workouts. Grocery items have quantity/price fields, meals include macro nutrients and ingredients, and workouts include workout type/intensity and exercise details.

Non‑working or problematic features
Feature	Issue
Task timeline ordering	Tasks scheduled after noon appear in the wrong time slot on the daily timeline (e.g., a task scheduled for 18:30 shows in the 3 PM row)

deluxe-souffle-b9b7f7.netlify.app
. This mis‑alignment makes it difficult to read the schedule.
Drag & drop reordering	The interface advertises drag‑and‑drop task reordering, but dragging a task card had no effect; tasks remained in their original positions.
Time picker	The time picker uses scrollable hour/minute lists that “jump” unpredictably; selecting a specific time (e.g., 02:00) is difficult because the values scroll past quickly.
AI Task Analyzer (Basic mode)	In the Basic mode (no API key), the analyzer ignores the user’s input and returns generic tasks (e.g., “Prepare for meeting” when asked to “Call mom at 10 AM and buy groceries at 6 PM”)

deluxe-souffle-b9b7f7.netlify.app
. Additionally, the “Analyze & Generate Tasks” button is only visible after scrolling inside the modal, which many users may miss.
AI Analyzer modal scrolling	The page and modal scroll bars conflict. Scrolling down inside the modal sometimes causes the whole page to scroll and closes the modal unexpectedly—this happened when trying to select generated tasks.
Ask AI input field	After sending a question in the “Ask AI” modal, the input field collapses, preventing additional questions without re‑opening the modal.
Habit tracker & streaks	Although the features list mentions daily/weekly habits and streak tracking, there is no visible habit tracker bar on the dashboard, and no way to mark habits as complete; thus habit functionality appears incomplete or hidden.
Meal/grocery/workout backend	While the UI allows adding grocery items, meals and workouts, attempting to add them resulted in no visible list or confirmation. These unified item types may not be fully integrated into the backend (the roadmap notes backend “pending” for unified item types).
Analytics completeness	The Week View page shows weekly and category progress, but it lacks the promised habit streak charts, weekly summary and detailed productivity insights (only an “AI Insights” box on the dashboard says “Complete more tasks to unlock personalized AI recommendations!”).
Notifications	Browser notifications are blocked by default and there is no in‑app guide to enable them. Without enabling notifications at the browser level, reminders will not work

.
Project management	Although the features list mentions projects and color‑coded grouping, there is no dedicated project view. Projects can be selected during task creation, but there is no page for project management or analytics.
Accessibility and voice control	The presence of voice toggles is promising, but there is no feedback when clicking the microphone or adjusting voice settings, and the voice settings modal (gear icon) doesn’t open. There is no visible support for keyboard navigation or screen readers.

User Experience Analysis
Positive aspects
Visual appeal and consistency – The dark, glass‑morphism design is attractive and consistent across pages. Colors for categories (fitness, work, personal) help differentiate tasks. The layout is responsive and works well on desktop.

Navigation – The left sidebar provides quick access to the dashboard, add item page, week view, settings and AI tools. Top buttons for AI Analyzer, Ask AI, Clear Today, Add Task and Week View further facilitate navigation.

Forms adapt to item type – The Add Item page dynamically changes inputs based on whether the user is creating a task, habit, grocery item, meal or workout, reducing clutter and confusion.

Settings granularity – Many configurable settings (notifications, AI suggestions, completion sounds, calendar sync, data export) allow users to personalize the app

.

Focus suggestions – The Ask AI feature provides quick stats and suggests which task to tackle first, adding value beyond simple scheduling

Friction points & suggestions
Time picker and timeline ordering – The scrollable time picker and timeline mis‑alignment cause frustration. Replace the picker with a standard drop‑down or numeric input, and ensure tasks appear at the correct time on the timeline.

Drag & drop – Task reordering should be fully functional with visible indicators and smooth animations. Consider adding a reorder icon and restricting vertical movement to the timeline area.

AI Analyzer UI – Move the “Analyze & Generate Tasks” button to the bottom of the modal but ensure it is always visible (use a sticky footer). Ensure the modal captures scroll events to prevent accidental page scrolling.

Natural language parsing – Basic mode returns irrelevant suggestions. Provide a disclaimer that Basic mode uses sample tasks or offer a limited but functional parser (e.g., extract time and title from short phrases).

Habit tracking visibility – Display habits and streak counters on the dashboard (e.g., a habit bar at the top) and provide quick completion buttons as described in the features list.

AI Assistant side‑panel – The “AI Assistant” label in the sidebar implies an interactive assistant. Consider opening the Ask AI modal when clicked or providing a side‑panel with real‑time recommendations.

Feedback for voice actions – When toggling voice assistant or clicking the microphone, display feedback (e.g., “Listening…” or a waveform). The gear icon should open a voice settings modal for adjusting language, voice and speed.

Analytics depth – Add promised charts such as habit streaks, weekly summaries and category distribution pie charts. Provide tooltips or descriptions explaining each metric.

Project management – Implement a dedicated project dashboard with color‑coded progress bars and the ability to filter tasks by project.

Notifications guidance – Provide instructions or a link explaining how to enable browser notifications. Consider fallback in‑app reminders if push notifications are not permitted.

Accessibility improvements – Include ARIA labels, keyboard‑navigable controls, color‑contrast adjustments and optional light theme. Provide an accessible on‑boarding for voice and screen‑reader users.

Performance Analysis
Load times – Pages load quickly with minimal delay; skeleton spinners appear briefly during navigation. The dynamic Add Item and AI modals load instantly, and the Week View page draws charts without major lag.

Responsiveness – UI elements resize appropriately when the window size changes. However, some animations (e.g., hovering over cards) slightly delay interactions; optimize animation durations for snappier feel.

Browser resource usage – The app seems lightweight; CPU usage remains low except when the AI analyzer runs, which triggers a loading spinner for several seconds.

UI / Visual Design Analysis
Strengths – Cohesive aesthetic, good color palette, clear typography and iconography. Gradient backgrounds and subtle animations enhance the experience.

Areas for improvement – The heavy use of dark gradients may reduce readability in bright conditions. Some texts (e.g., progress labels) are faint; increasing contrast would help. The timeline grid lines are subtle; adding a clearer demarcation for each hour and labeling tasks with end times could improve clarity.

Security Analysis
Strengths – The app uses HTTPS and JWT‑based authentication. Users can export or delete data and clear local cache

deluxe-souffle-b9b7f7.netlify.app
. The OpenAI API key field explains that keys are stored locally and not sent to servers

deluxe-souffle-b9b7f7.netlify.app
.

Concerns – The Supabase public anon key is likely embedded in the client code (common for Supabase apps); ensure row‑level security policies are properly configured. There is no visible password change option or multi‑factor authentication. The app should handle tasks deletion confirmation carefully (a confirm dialog appears for clearing daily tasks but not for account deletion). Notifications rely on browser permissions; ensure fallback to local notifications if denied.

Recommended Action Items
Fix timeline ordering and time picker – ensure tasks display in correct time slots and replace the buggy scroll picker with a user‑friendly time selector.

Enable drag‑and‑drop – implement functional drag‑and‑drop with proper event handling and visual cues.

Improve AI analyzer – either hide the feature until an API key is supplied or provide a simple rule‑based parser; make the action button sticky and fix modal scroll behaviour.

Add habit tracker UI – display habits and streak counts on the dashboard with one‑tap completion; integrate habit analytics into the Week View.

Expand analytics and projects – include habit streak charts, weekly summaries and project dashboards as described in the features documentation.

Clarify voice assistant features – provide a working settings panel for voice options and feedback when listening or speaking.

Enhance accessibility – implement keyboard navigation, ARIA labels and improved contrast; consider a light theme option.

Add in‑app guidance for notifications – show users how to enable browser notifications or provide in‑app reminders when push notifications are unavailable.

Review security & privacy – add the ability to change passwords, support MFA, and double‑check Supabase RLS policies to prevent unauthorized access.

Implement unified item types backend – complete backend logic for grocery lists, meals and workouts so that items added in the UI persist and appear in dashboards.

HealthyFlow has a solid foundation with an attractive UI and promising AI‑driven features, but there are critical functional and UX issues to address before it can deliver the seamless productivity experience described in the feature specification.
